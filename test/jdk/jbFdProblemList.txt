#
# List of tests that should not be run by test/Makefile, for various reasons:
#   1. Does not run with jtreg -samevm mode
#   2. Causes problems in jtreg -samevm mode for jtreg or tests that follow it
#   3. The test is too slow or consumes too many system resources
#   4. The test fails when run on any official build systems
#
# It is possible that a test being on this list is a mistake, and that some
#   other test in samevm mode caused tests to fail, mistakes happen.
#
# Tests marked @ignore are not run by test/Makefile, but harmless to be listed.
#
# Tests that explicitly state "@run main/othervm ...", and are not listed here,
#   will be run in the same batch as the samevm tests.
#
# Shell tests are othervm by default.
#
# List items are testnames followed by labels, all MUST BE commented
#   as to why they are here and use a label:
#     generic-all   Problems on all platforms
#     generic-ARCH  Where ARCH is one of: x64, i586, ppc64, ppc64le, s390x, aarch64 etc.
#     OSNAME-all    Where OSNAME is one of: linux, windows, macosx, aix
#     OSNAME-ARCH   Specific on to one OSNAME and ARCH, e.g. macosx-x64
#     OSNAME-REV    Specific on to one OSNAME and REV, e.g. macosx-10.7.4
#
# More than one label is allowed but must be on the same line comma seperated,
# without spaces.
# If there are several lines mentioning the same test, the last one is used.
#
#############################################################################
#
# Running the tests:
#    cd test && make JT_HOME=jtreg_home PRODUCT_HOME=jdk_home jdk_all
#  Or instead of jdk_all, use any of the jdk_* targets.
#
# Samevm Notes:
#  * Although some tests may have only been seen to fail on some platforms,
#    they might be flagged as 'generic-all' because the problem they have
#    could cause hidden slowdowns on other platforms.
#    Most samevm problems will be generic-all, but windows usually dislikes
#    them the most.
#    Address already in use or connection errors indicate a generic port issue.
#    (this is not necessarily a samevm issue, but an issue for running the tests
#     on shared machines, two people or two test runs will collide).
#  * Samevm problem (windows in particular) is not closing all input/output
#  * Samevm problem when a test calls setSecurityManager()
#  * Samevm problem with setHttps*() is used? (not exactly sure here)
#  * Samevm problem when stuffing system properties with non Strings or anything
#  * Samevm problem when changing vm settings, or registering any vm actions
#  * Samevm problems with deleteOnExit(), if it must happen at end of test
#  * Samevm problems with URLClassLoader? (no details here)
#  * Samevm problems with dependence on predictable GC or finalizations
#
# Any of the above problems may mean the test needs to be flagged as "othervm".
#
#############################################################################
#
# Fixing the tests:
#
# Some tests just may need to be run with "othervm", and that can easily be
#   done by adding a @run line (or modifying any existing @run):
#      @run main/othervm NameOfMainClass
#   Make sure this @run follows any use of @library.
#   Otherwise, if the test is a samevm possibility, make sure the test is
#     cleaning up after itself, closing all streams, deleting temp files, etc.
#
# Keep in mind that the bug could be in many places, and even different per
#   platform, it could be a bug in any one of:
#      - the testcase
#      - the jdk (jdk classes, native code, or hotspot)
#      - the native compiler
#      - the javac compiler
#      - the OS (depends on what the testcase does)
#
# If you managed to really fix one of these tests, here is how you can
#    remove tests from this list:
#  1. Make sure test passes on all platforms with samevm, or mark it othervm
#  2. Make sure test passes on all platforms when run with it's entire group
#  3. Make sure both VMs are tested, -server and -client, if possible
#  4. Use your favorite build and test system to verify these results
#  5. Delete lines in this file, include the changes with your test changes
#
# You may need to repeat your testing 2 or even 3 times to verify good
#   results, some of these samevm failures are not very predictable.
