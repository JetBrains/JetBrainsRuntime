 * Description
 *     The test verifies that JVM prints tiered events with -XX:+PrintTieredEvents
 *     for tiered compilation explicitly enabled with -XX:+TieredCompilation.
 *     If tiered compilation is explicitly disabled the test verifies that there are no
 *     output from PrintTieredEvents.
