# Welcome to JetBrains Runtime!

JetBrains Runtime is a fork of [OpenJDK](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk) available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
It supports enhanced class redefinition ([DCEVM](https://ssw.jku.at/dcevm/)),
features optional [JCEF](https://github.com/JetBrains/jcef), a framework for embedding Chromium-based browsers,
includes a number of improvements in font rendering, keyboards support, 
windowing/focus subsystems, HiDPI, accessibility, and performance, provides better desktop integration
and bugfixes not yet present in OpenJDK.

> **_NOTE_**: This is a **development** branch that is periodically synchronized with 
> the [OpenJDK master](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/tree/master) branch.
> 
 Release builds are based on these branches:
 * [jbr11](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime/tree/jbr11) (JDK 11)
 * [jbr17](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime/tree/jbr17) (JDK 17)
 
Download the latest releases of JetBrains Runtime to use with JetBrains IDEs. The full list
can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime/releases).

## Why Use JetBrains Runtime?
* **Embedded browser**: JetBrains Runtime includes the Java Chromium Embedded Framework ([JCEF](https://github.com/JetBrains/jcef)), which
  enables you to embed a Chromium-based browsers in your JVM-based application. 
 To use it, [download a build with JCEF](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime/releases).
* **Enhanced class re-definition** with the [DCEVM](https://ssw.jku.at/dcevm/) technology that makes it easier to reload
  changed code without restarting JVM; this feature needs to be explicitly enabled with `-XX:+AllowEnhancedClassRedefinition`.
* **Better FPS performance** for graphics-intensive applications.
* **Improved font rendering**, **keyboard input** (such as shortcuts and multinational keyboards),
  **HiDPI** and **accessibility** support.
* **Robust desktop experience**: GUI-related fixes often reach JetBrains Runtime much earlier than the corresponding version of OpenJDK.

## Getting Sources
### macOS, Linux
```
git config --global core.autocrlf input
git clone git@github.com:JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime.git
```

### Windows
<a name="sources-windows"></a>
```
git config --global core.autocrlf false
git clone git@github.com:JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime.git
```

## Configuring the Build Environment
Here are quick per-platform instructions for those who can't wait to get started. 
Please refer to [OpenJDK build docs](https://openjdk.java.net/groups/build/doc/building.html) for in-depth
coverage of all the details.

> **_TIP:_**  To get a preliminary report of what's missing, run `./configure` and check its output. 
> It would usually have meaningful advice on how to solve the problem.

### Linux (Docker)
Create a container:
```
$ cd jb/project/docker
$ docker build .
...
Successfully built 942ea9900054
```
Run these commands in the new container:
```
$ docker run -v `pwd`../../../../:/JetBrainsRuntime -it 942ea9900054
# cd /JetBrainsRuntime
# sh ./configure
# make images CONF=linux-x86_64-normal-server-release
```

### Ubuntu Linux
Install the necessary tools, libraries, and headers with:
```
$ sudo apt-get install autoconf make build-essential libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrender-dev libxtst-dev \
       libxt-dev libxrandr-dev libcups2-dev libfontconfig1-dev libasound2-dev
```
Get Java 18 (for instance, [Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK 18](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-18-sts&os=linux&package=jdk)).

Then run the following:
```
$ cd JetBrainsRuntime
$ git checkout main
$ sh ./configure
$ make images
```
This will build the release configuration under `./build/linux-x86_64-server-release/`.

### Windows
<a name="build-windows"></a>
Install the following:
* [Cygwin x64](http://www.cygwin.com/).
  Required packages: `autoconf`, `binutils`, `cpio`, `diffutils`, `file`, `gawk`, `gcc-core`, `make`, `m4`, `unzip`, `zip`.  
  Install those together with Cygwin.
* [Visual Studio compiler toolset](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
  Install with the desktop development kit, which includes Windows SDK and compilers.
  Visual Studio 2019 is supported by default.
* Java 18 (for instance, [Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK 18](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-18-sts&os=windows&package=jdk)).
  If you have problems while configuring, read [Java tips on Cygwin](http://horstmann.com/articles/cygwin-tips.html).

From the command line: 
```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64
"c:\Program_Files\cygwin64\bin\mintty.exe" /bin/bash -l
```
The first command sets up environment variables, the second starts a Cygwin shell with the proper environment.  

In the Cygwin shell: 
```
$ cd JetBrainsRuntime
$ git checkout main
$ bash configure --with-toolchain-version=2019
$ make images
```
This will build the release configuration under `./build/windows-x86_64-server-release/`.

### macOS
Install the following:
* Xcode command line developer tools and `autoconf` via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
* Java 18 (for instance, [Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK 18](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-18-sts&os=macos&package=jdk)).

From the command line:
```
$ cd JetBrainsRuntime
$ git checkout main
$ sh ./configure
$ make images
```
This will build the release configuration under `./build/macosx-x86_64-server-release/`.

## Developing
You can use  [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) to develop native parts of the JetBrains Runtime and
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for the parts written in Java.
Both require projects to be created.

### CLion
Run
```
$ make compile-commands
```
in the git root and open the resulting `build/.../compile_commands.json` file as a project.
Then use `Tools | Compilation Database | Change Project Root` to point to git root of this repository.

See also this detailed step-by-step tutorial for all platforms:
[How to develop OpenJDK with CLion](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2020/03/openjdk-with-clion/).

### IDEA
Run
```
$ sh ./bin/idea.sh
```
in the git root to generate project files (add `--help` for options). If you have multiple
configurations (for example, `release` and `fastdebug`), supply the `--conf <conf_name>` argument.
Then open the git root directory as a project in IDEA.
