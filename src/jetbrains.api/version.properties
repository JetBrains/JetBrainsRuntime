# When any changes are made to jetbrains.api module, hash and version value MUST be updated in this file.
# Version has the following format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
#
# How to increment JBR API version?
# 1. For small changes if no public API was changed (e.g. only javadoc changes) - increment PATCH
# 2. When only new API is added, or some existing API was @Deprecated - increment MINOR, reset PATCH to 0
# 3. For major backwards incompatible API changes - increment MAJOR, reset MINOR and PATCH to 0

VERSION = 0.0.0

# Hash is used to track changes to jetbrains.api, so you would not forget to update version when needed.
# When you make any changes, "make jbr-api" will fail and ask you to update hash and version number here.
