#include "SurfaceData.h"

typedef struct WLSDOps WLSDOps;

/*
 * This function returns a pointer to a native WLSDOps structure
 * for accessing the indicated WL SurfaceData Java object. It
 * verifies that the indicated SurfaceData object is an instance
 * of WLSurfaceData before returning and will return NULL if the
 * wrong SurfaceData object is being accessed.  This function will
 * throw the appropriate Java exception if it returns NULL so that
 * the caller can simply return.
 *
 * Note to callers:
 *      This function uses JNI methods so it is important that the
 *      caller not have any outstanding GetPrimitiveArrayCritical or
 *      GetStringCritical locks which have not been released.
 *
 *      The caller may continue to use JNI methods after this method
 *      is called since this function will not leave any outstanding
 *      JNI Critical locks unreleased.
