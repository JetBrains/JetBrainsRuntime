                      However, freetype scaler is basically small wrapper on
                      top of freetype library (that is used in binary form).

                      This wrapper is compiled into fontmanager and this make
                      fontmanger library depending on freetype library.

                      On Windows DLL's in the JRE's BIN directory cannot be
                      found by windows DLL loading as that directory is not
                      on the Windows PATH.

                      To avoid link error we have to load freetype explicitly
                      before we load fontmanager.

                      NB: consider moving freetype wrapper part to separate
                          shared library in order to avoid dependency. */
