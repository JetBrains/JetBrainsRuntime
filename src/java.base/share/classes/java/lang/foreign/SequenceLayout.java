 * struct layout where the sequence layout's element layout is repeated a number of times that is equal to the sequence
 * layout's element count. In other words this layout:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MemoryLayout.sequenceLayout(3, ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withOrder(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN));
 * }
 *
 * is equivalent to the following layout:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MemoryLayout.structLayout(
 *     ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withOrder(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN),
 *     ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withOrder(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN),
