class PartialArrayStateAllocator;

// Instances of this class are used to represent processing progress for an
// array task in a taskqueue.  When a sufficiently large array needs to be
// processed, such that it is desirable to split up the processing into
// parallelizable subtasks, a state object is allocated for the array.
// Multiple tasks referring to the state can then be added to the taskqueue
// for later processing, either by the current thread or by some other thread
// that steals one of those tasks.
//
// Processing a state involves using the state to claim a segment of the
// array, and processing that segment.  Claiming is done by atomically
// incrementing the index, thereby claiming the segment from the old to new
// index values.  New tasks should also be added as needed to ensure the
// entire array will be processed.  A PartialArrayTaskStepper can be used to
// help with this.
//
// States are allocated and released using a PartialArrayStateAllocator.
// States are reference counted to aid in that management.  Each task
// referring to a given state that is added to a taskqueue must increase the
// reference count by one.  When the processing of a task referring to a state
// is complete, the reference count must be decreased by one.  When the
// reference count reaches zero the state should be released to the allocator
// for later reuse.

// This class provides memory management for PartialArrayStates.
//
// States are initially allocated from a set of arenas owned by the allocator.
// This allows the entire set of allocated states to be discarded without the
// need to keep track of or find them under some circumstances.  For example,
// if G1 concurrent marking is aborted and needs to restart because of a full
// marking queue, the queue doesn't need to be searched for tasks referring to
// states to allow releasing them.  Instead the queue contents can just be
// discarded, and the memory for the no longer referenced states will
// eventually be reclaimed when the arenas are reset.
//
// A set of free-lists is placed in front of the arena allocators.  This
// causes the maximum number of allocated states to be based on the number of
// in-progress arrays, rather than the total number of arrays that need to be
// processed.  The use of free-list allocators is the reason for reference
// counting states.
//
// The arena and free-list to use for an allocation operation is designated by
// the worker_id used in the operation.  This avoids locking and such on those
// data structures, at the cost of possibly doing more total arena allocation
// that would be needed with a single shared arena and free-list.
